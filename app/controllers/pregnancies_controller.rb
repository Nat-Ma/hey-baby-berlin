                      In the basic ultrasound examination, the age-appropriate development of the child is checked. Individual
                      organs are not examined in more detail. Rather, the size of the head and abdomen and the length of the
                      thigh bone are measured and the amount of amniotic fluid is determined. The position of the placenta in
                      the uterus is also checked. If there are any abnormalities, they can be clarified by further examinations.
                      In the extended basic ultrasound examination, the head, brain chambers and cerebellum are also examined
                      more closely and the size ratio of the chest and heart is measured. The heartbeat and the position and
                      size of the ventricles are also checked. It is also checked whether the abdominal wall and the spine are
                      closed and whether the stomach and bladder are visible.
                      Both the basic ultrasound and the extended basic ultrasound are services provided by statutory health
                      insurance companies. They can only be carried out by gynecologists with the appropriate qualifications.
                      If the doctor treating you does not have this qualification, you will need to be referred to another
                      gynecological practice for this examination.",
